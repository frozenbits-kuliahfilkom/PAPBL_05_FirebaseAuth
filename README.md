This app is going to display your current location on google maps.

The file for the Maps API key is stored in /app/src/debug/res/values/google_maps_api.xml, which is not included here.
To recreate the file, create a new Maps Activity in Android Studio and the file will generate itself. 
Follow the instructions to get your own API key.
